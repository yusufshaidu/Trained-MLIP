# MLIPs_Library
This repository is aim to deploy our machine learning interatomic potentials trained for specific application. 
We will include equivariant models as well as model trained on invariant-based models. We have potentials for the following systems:

- [ ] Elemental carbon trained on diversed carbon dataset.
- [ ] Amine-appended metal-organic frameworks featuring Mg2(dobpdc) variant.
- [ ] Multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.
