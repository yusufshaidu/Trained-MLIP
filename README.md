This repository is aim to deploy our machine learning interatomic potentials trained for specific application. 
We will include equivariant models as well as model trained on invariant-based models. We have potentials for the following systems:

- [ ] Elemental carbon trained on diversed carbon dataset (Shaidu, Y., Küçükbenli, E., Lot, R. et al. A systematic approach to generating accurate neural network potentials: the case of carbon. npj Comput Mater 7, 52 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00508-6).
